The commit you've provided introduces several changes to the codebase, including updates to API endpoints, UI components, and configuration files. Here's a summary of what has been changed: ### Code Updates 1. **API Endpoint Update:** - **REST API Configuration:** Updated REST API configuration in `src/api/lib/config.json` to reflect changes in the commit message. This includes modifications to how endpoints are defined and accessed, potentially affecting how data is fetched from or sent to the server. 2. **UI Component Update:** - **AISearchCTAPopup Component:** Added a new component `AISearchCTAPopup` in `src/search/components/input/AISearchCTAPopup.tsx`. This component is designed to handle the display and interaction logic for a call-to-action (CTA) popover related to AI search functionality. - **AskAIResults Component:** Updated `AskAIResults` in `src/search/components/input/AskAIResults.tsx` to include logic that dismisses the CTA popover when an AI search is performed. This ensures a smoother user experience by automatically closing the popover after triggering an action that might be considered disruptive to the flow initiated by the popover itself. - **OldSearchInput Component:** Modified `OldSearchInput` in `src/search/components/input/OldSearchInput.tsx` to switch from using `useBreakpoint` to `useMinWidthBreakpoint` for determining viewport size, reflecting a shift towards more device-specific responsiveness in the UI components. - **SearchBarButton Component:** Updated `SearchBarButton` in `src/search/components/input/SearchBarButton.tsx` to include a reference to the new `AISearchCTAPopup` component and integrate it into the button's rendering logic, ensuring that the CTA popover is displayed as needed within the search interface. 3. **Webhook Configuration Update:** - Updated webhooks configuration in `src/webhooks/lib/config.json` to match changes made in other parts of the codebase. This includes adjustments to how events are managed and triggered through webhooks, which might be related to backend services or external integrations that the application interacts with. ### Configuration File Updates 4. **REST API Configuration:** Updated `src/api/lib/config.json` to reflect changes in endpoint definitions and data handling mechanisms. This file contains metadata about how APIs are structured and used within the application, including details such as request methods (GET, POST), endpoints, headers, and body parameters. 5. **Webhooks Configuration:** Updated `src/webhooks/lib/config.json` to align with changes in event management and trigger logic. This file typically contains settings for webhook subscriptions, payload formats, and integration points with external systems or services. ### Summary of Changes The commit introduces several enhancements and updates aimed at improving the user experience, API handling, and UI responsiveness across different devices. Key changes include: - **API Configuration:** Refined REST API endpoints to better align with new functionality introduced in the `AISearchCTAPopup` component. - **UI Components:** Updated components such as search bars, call-to-action popovers, and responsive layouts to ensure compatibility with mobile and desktop environments. - **Webhook Management:** Adjusted webhook configurations to support new event triggers related to AI functionalities within the application. These changes collectively aim to streamline interactions within the application, enhance user engagement, and improve the overall technical architecture of the platform by refining data handling and API integrations.
