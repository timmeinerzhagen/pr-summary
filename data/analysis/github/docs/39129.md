## High-Level Summary

### Summary
- Dockerfile: Split into granular stages (`prod_deps`, `all_deps`, `build`, `warmup_cache`, `precompute_stage`) for optimized caching and parallelization. Production stage now uses only production dependencies.
- Docs: Updated Copilot premium request reset time to specify UTC (`00:00:00 UTC`).
- Script: Modified `fetch-repos.sh` to clone translation repositories asynchronously for efficiency.
