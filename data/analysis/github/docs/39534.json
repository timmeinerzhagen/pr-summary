  "raw_analysis": "<think>Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a summary of a GitHub Pull Request based on the provided git diff. The commits are updating a documentation file related to managing a Copilot plan.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the diff. The main changes are in the intro line where \"your your\" is corrected to \"your\". That's a typo fix. Then, in the note about organization access, they added a comma after \"organization\" and fixed the conditional for enterprise mention. The syntax there is important for proper rendering. \n\nNext, there's a section where they removed a specific instruction about navigating to the \"Add-ons\" section and a screenshot reference. Simplifying the steps by removing redundant details. Also, changing \"{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}\" to \"{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}\" in the cancellation step, which is a variable name correction for consistency.\n\nThe key changes are typo fixes, conditional formatting improvements, and simplifying documentation steps. The title should reflect that it's about documentation updates, specifically for Copilot plan management. Need to make sure the summary is concise, bullet points, under 100 words. Title should be short but descriptive.\n</think>\n\n### Summary\n- Fixed duplicate \"your\" typo in documentation intro\n- Improved conditional enterprise mention syntax in access restrictions note\n- Simplified trial cancellation instructions by removing redundant UI path details\n- Updated variable reference to use short name consistently\n- Removed obsolete screenshot reference from cancellation steps\n\n### Title\nDocs: Refine Copilot plan management documentation clarity and consistency"
