  "original_description": "<!--\r\nThank you for contributing to this project! You must fill out the information below before we can review this pull request. By explaining why you're making a change (or linking to an issue) and what changes you've made, we can triage your pull request to the best possible team for review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Why:\r\n\r\nThe current account and profile documentation frontmatter and intro text were a bit wordy and could be clearer. Improving these will help users understand the purpose of the page quickly and improve the maintainability of the YAML frontmatter for future edits.\r\n\r\n### What's being changed (if available, include any code snippets, screenshots, or gifs):\r\n\r\n- Reworded the intro to use more concise and natural language:\r\n  - Changed \"adjusting the settings\" to \"customizing your personal account settings\"\r\n  - Changed \"managing the notifications you receive\" to \"managing your notification preferences\"\r\n- Converted the intro string from single-quoted to multi-line YAML format for easier readability and editing.\r\n- Cleaned up YAML formatting and indentation for better consistency.\r\n- No visual UI changes; documentation metadata improvements only.\r\n\r\n### Check off the following:\r\n\r\n- [x] A subject matter expert (SME) has reviewed the technical accuracy of the content in this PR.
