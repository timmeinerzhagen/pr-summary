  "raw_analysis": "<think>Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a git diff and commit messages, and wants a summary of the PR. The key changes are in the GitHub Actions documentation, removing a deprecated tool, updating Dependabot config, and restructuring Copilot policies.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the git diff. The main changes are in the Actions files, adding matrix strategy examples and restructuring the workflow syntax documentation. There's a removal of ghe-export-graphs from monitoring docs. The Dependabot config now includes a cooldown option. The Copilot policies section was restructured, moving some content to new files and adding details on code referencing and policy management.\n\nThe commits mention restructuring organization/enterprise Copilot policies, documenting issue creation with the API, adding cooldown to multi-ecosystem updates, workflow job variations, and removing ghe-export-graphs.\n\nSo the key changes are:\n1. Enhanced GitHub Actions matrix strategy documentation with examples.\n2. Removed deprecated ghe-export-graphs tool from monitoring docs.\n3. Added cooldown option to Dependabot multi-ecosystem config.\n4. Restructured Copilot policy documentation, clarifying code referencing and policy management.\n\nThe title should reflect these main points concisely. Maybe something like \"Enhance docs for Actions matrix, Dependabot cooldown, and Copilot policies; remove deprecated tool.\"\n\nChecking the word limit, need to keep it under 100 words. Use bullet points, group by topic. Make sure to mention each key area without going into too much detail. Avoid paragraphs, stick to concise bullets.\n</think>\n\n### Summary\n- **GitHub Actions**: Expanded matrix strategy documentation with configuration examples, include/exclude patterns, and failure handling.\n- **Monitoring**: Removed deprecated `ghe-export-graphs` tool from instance monitoring documentation.\n- **Dependabot**: Added `cooldown` option to multi-ecosystem update configurations.\n- **Copilot**: Restructured policy documentation, added code referencing details, and clarified enterprise/organization policy management.\n\n### Title  \nEnhance docs for Actions matrix, Dependabot cooldown, and Copilot policies; remove deprecated tool"
