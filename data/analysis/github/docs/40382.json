  "original_description": "Added details on configuring private proxies and direct access for Go modules.\r\n\r\n### Why:\r\nImproved documentation clarity for developers configuring Dependabot with private Go modules. The existing documentation lacked specific guidance on different proxy configurations and their trade-offs, leading to confusion about setup options and security implications.\r\n\r\n### What's being changed (if available, include any code snippets, screenshots, or gifs):\r\nEnhanced the Notes section for Go module configuration with three distinct setup scenarios:\r\n\r\n- **Private Proxy Serving All Modules**: Clarified proxy fallback behavior and limitations for JFrog-only modules\r\n- **Private Proxy Serving Private Modules**: Added guidance on multiple registry configuration and security considerations  \r\n- **Direct Access to Private Modules**: Explained VCS authentication requirements and proper module publishing prerequisites\r\n\r\nAdded emphasis on `GONOSUMDB` requirement for private modules and clarified when VCS fallback will/won't work based on module publishing strategy.\r\n\r\n### Check off the following:\r\n\r\n- [ ] A subject matter expert (SME) has reviewed the technical accuracy of the content in this PR. In most cases, the author can be the SME. Open source contributions may require an SME review from GitHub staff.\r\n- [ ] The changes in this PR meet [the docs fundamentals that are required for all content](http://docs.github.com/en/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/about-githubs-documentation-fundamentals).\r\n- [ ] All CI checks are passing and the changes look good in the review environment.\r\n",
