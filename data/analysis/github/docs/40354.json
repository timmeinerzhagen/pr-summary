    "**Git Credential Manager (GCM) & Enterprise Managed Users (EMU)**: Added documentation on SSO redirect settings affecting GCM behavior. EMU users must disable GCM account filtering if SSO redirect is off to avoid repeated authentication prompts.",

Noted that alternative identifiers (e.g., `javascript`) don't exclude related languages (e.g., TypeScript).",
