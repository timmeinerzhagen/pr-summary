By explaining why you're making a change (or linking to an issue) and what changes you've made, we can triage your pull request to the best possible team for review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Why:\r\n\r\nThe docs need to emphasise that the upgrade of the primary needs to fully complete before doing other nodes; trying to upgrade a replica will result in errors if the configuration run hasn't fully completed on the primary.\r\n\r\n### Check off the following:\r\n\r\n- [x] A subject matter expert (SME) has reviewed the technical accuracy of the content in this PR. In most cases, the author can be the SME.
