  "original_description": "### Why:\r\n\r\nAccording to [official manuals](https://docs.docker.com/compose/intro/compose-application-model/#the-compose-file),\r\n\r\n> The default path for a Compose file is `compose.yaml` (preferred) or `compose.yml` that is placed in the working directory.\r\n> Compose also supports `docker-compose.yaml` and `docker-compose.yml` for backwards compatibility of earlier versions.\r\n> If both files exist, Compose prefers the canonical `compose.yaml`.\r\n\r\nSo `compose.yaml` is preferred to `docker-compose.yml`.\r\n\r\n### What's being changed (if available, include any code snippets, screenshots, or gifs):\r\n\r\nUpdate documentation to replace references to `docker-compose.yml` with `compose.yaml` for consistency across content.\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n- Replace occurrences of `docker-compose.yml` with `compose.yaml` in the style guide\r\n- Update codespaces additional container config documentation to reference `compose.yaml` instead of `docker-compose.yml`\r\n\r\n### Check off the following:\r\n\r\n- [ ] A subject matter expert (SME) has reviewed the technical accuracy of the content in this PR.
