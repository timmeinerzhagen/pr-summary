  "original_description": "### Why:\r\n\r\n1. The links pointing to the specific SHA and file path are outdated. The files have been moved around. See https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/646 for more details. Note: because the links were using specific SHA they were still working, they are just pointing to an old version. There is one actual meaningful difference (language regex is wrong).\r\n\r\n### What's being changed (if available, include any code snippets, screenshots, or gifs):\r\n\r\nOnly the pointed links changed:\r\n * The link `SARIF specfication documentation` now points to the docs, not the schema. This is the same URL to where the `OASIS Standard` link points.\r\n * The schema links using SHA has been replaced to point to the link used in the spec.\r\n\r\n### Check off the following:\r\n\r\n- [ ] A subject matter expert (SME) has reviewed the technical accuracy of the content in this PR.
