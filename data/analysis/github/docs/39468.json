  "raw_analysis": "<think>Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a git diff from a GitHub Pull Request and wants a summary of the changes. The summary should include key changes grouped by topic and a short title. The answer needs to be concise, in bullet points, and under 100 words.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the commits listed. They mention EDI-ifying several documentation pages, updating links for GitHub Copilot, a script for filepaths, retired namespaces, enforcing artifact attestations with Kubernetes, showing request content types in REST API examples, and moving some how-tos to tutorials.\n\nLooking at the git diff, the main changes are:\n\n1. **Kubernetes Admissions Controller Documentation**: A new file `kubernetes-admissions-controller.md` is added under security concepts. It explains using Sigstore Policy Controller to enforce artifact attestations in Kubernetes. The how-to guide was updated to remove redundant info and link to the new concept page.\n\n2. **Workflow Cancellation Process**: The cancellation documentation was moved to a new reference page. The original how-to now links to this reference, streamlining the content.\n\n3. **Sharing Actions from Private Repos**: The documentation was simplified. Steps to configure repository access were made more direct, removing some explanations and linking to reuse workflows.\n\n4. **Pre-written Building Blocks**: The guide was condensed, focusing on practical steps without detailed explanations. Removed sections on overview and next steps.\n\n5. **Content Reorganization**: Moved use cases and examples to tutorials, updated internal links, and adjusted the docs homepage to reflect new structure.\n\n6. **REST API Examples**: Added display of request content types in dropdowns when they differ between examples.\n\nNow, grouping these by topic:\n\n- **Security Enhancements**: Added Kubernetes admissions controller docs for artifact attestation enforcement.\n- **Documentation Improvements**: Streamlined cancellation, private action sharing, and pre-written blocks guides; reorganized content into tutorials.\n- **API Usability**: Enhanced REST examples with request content type visibility.\n\nThe title should encapsulate the main themes: security, docs restructuring, and API updates.\n\nFinal checks: Ensure each bullet is concise, keywords are highlighted, and the title is descriptive yet brief.\n</think>\n\n### Summary\n- **Security Enhancements**: Added Kubernetes admission controller documentation for enforcing artifact attestations, including trust root configuration and image verification processes.\n- **Documentation Restructuring**: Moved use case examples to tutorials, streamlined workflow cancellation instructions into a reference guide, and simplified content on sharing private actions.\n- **Content Updates**: Revised action definitions, added script for path updates, retired namespace articles, and adjusted Copilot documentation links.\n- **API Improvements**: Introduced request content type display in REST API example dropdowns for clarity.\n\n### Title\nEnhance security docs, streamline content structure, and improve API examples"
